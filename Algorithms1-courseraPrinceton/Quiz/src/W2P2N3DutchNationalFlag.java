 * Question 3: Permutation
 *
 * DNF: Given an array of n buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color.
 * The allowed operations are:
 * swap(i,j): swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j
 * color(i)determine the color of the pebble in bucket i
 *
 * The performance requirements are as follows:
 * At most n calls to color()
 * At most n calls to swap()
 * Constant extra space.
